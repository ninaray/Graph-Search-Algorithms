# Graph-Search-Algorithms
Final project for Advanced Data Structures online course.

This project involved working with pre-delivered code that utilized Google Maps API to simulate a map.
My requirements involved implementing and maintaining functions that used an adjacency list/matrix,
as well as BFS, Djikstra, and A* Search algorithms.

All methods commented with "********IMPLEMENTED BY NINA RAY" were created and tested myself. Only the files
with my work were uploaded due to concerns over privacy regarding the online course.
